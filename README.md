Army Aviation consists of multiple levels of training, but all have one thing in common in that all Army qualified Aviators have graduated from the Basic Army Aviator Course (BAAC) at Fort Rucker, AL. This course is twenty-two weeks in length (give or take a few days for weather delays in flight training). During this time prospective graduates are maintained on cohort schedule, regardless of progression speed and capabilities. All training events during this time are completed by an Instructor Pilot (IP), and all students must complete this training, also known as Phase 1 of Army Aviator training. 

There have been several studies and assessments completed by the Army over the last 20 years on how to best train combat aviators, but very little focus has been placed on training being completed through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and how it effects comprehension and trainability of future aviators. Previous research on the use of VR has been completed through a project call Aviator Training Next (ATN) which included three-hour increments of training in a new simulation device designed and researched during a one-year research project conducted in Fort Rucker, AL. 

This ATN research had a primary research question of: Does VR provide a viable training tool for Army Aviation? With a resounding answer of "Yes" to this question, our group looks to build upon this research and identify the differences between how students learn from a PowerPoint versus using the VR to train basic flight maneuvers prior to conducting live flight and support the ability to determine the ability to produce a higher quality Army Aviator through the integration of a Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display (VR HMD) in combination with commercial off the shelf (COTS) flight software and cockpit simulators to compare training capabilities with students that receive the same instruction via PowerPoint presentations only.

The independent variable is the method of training. The methods of training include a PowerPoint presentation and a flight simulation through vive eye pro. The dependent variables will be the success through each training method and the user satisfaction.

Flight training is inherently expensive, and thus both military and civilian organizations are looking for ways to reduce their budget. The question remains: How do you safely reduce both the budget and live flight-time safely? This study is not designed to provide that final answer, however it should provide some foundational information to show that VR is a viable training tool and can provide a more robust training capability, instead of students sitting in a classroom learning from slideshow lectures.

Quantitative analysis leverages a combination of experimental design and quasi-experimental design research. This experiment is composed of two experimental groups of 176 students, groups A and B, which are composed of 88 students each. Group A will conduct training through the use of PPT only and be tested in the VR device. Group B will conduct training in VR and be tested in the VR device as well. All testing will be conducted at Fort Rucker, AL, and will be managed by the Directorate of Simulation for the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence. 


This project makes the following contributions:

Contribution 1: The results of this experiment will highlight the benefits and detriments of two different types of aviation training methods. With this knowledge, the Army can create training plans within UPT (undergraduate pilot training) that will hopefully improve student passing rate compared to the methods used previously.

Contribution 2: The results will aid researchers within the aviation sector in creating technology that will help transform a better combat Army aviator. 


COMPONENT DESCRIPTION

What is VR?

This section is designed merely to give you, the reader, a brief explanation of what VR is and how that definition pertains to this study. It is not intended to delve deep into the subject of defining a virtual environment, of which has multiple definitions of its own. 
  
Virtual reality is not necessarily a new phenomenon in the technology business, however it continues to develop at a rapid pace, including its viability as a training tool. Virtual reality is, simply put, a technology based on a computer that displays an input developed into an output from a computer designed to provide the user with an environment that reflects the real world (Gandhi, n.d.) and is a way to use computers to bring the digital world to life. This can include multiple senses being used simultaneously such as seeing, hearing, and touch. This is done using sights, sounds, and our sense of balance to immerse the user into a fully digital world. An even more simple approach to this definition can be defined as using modeling and simulation computer equipment that allows a person to interact with an artificial 3D environment (Gandhi, n.d.).

There are several types of VR, such as enhanced, immersive, quick time, desktop, and hybrid. This project will concentrate on the use of immersive VR. This type of VR allows the user's real-world view to become computer-generated images, immersing them into a new world, which in this case is the training environment used to compare results of training in PPT and VR. Additional key points of immersive VR are that the user wears a head mounted display (HMD), and while doing so has no visual contact with the external physical environment. The HMD allows for constant tracking of where the individual is looking and although the HTC Vive Pro that is used in this study does not have a capability of eye tracking, there are several available additions that could add to the measurement of training performance allowing for a more in depth understanding and capabilities of each individual aviator. There is an ability of the observer to view where the student is looking via a monitor connected to the Helimod device used. 
  
There are a plethora of applications where VR can be used, which ranges from entertainment to training in several domains including military training. Virtual Reality (VR) as a term was coined by Jaron Lanier in 1987, and this technology was used in flight simulation as early as the 1950s where it was used to teach aspiring aviators how to fly, as well as how to conduct emergency procedure training. The obvious advantage of this is that training can be conducted without crashing aircraft, and as the cost of flight hours continues to rise there are budget advantages as well. This research is not going to cover budget, however, it's evident how it can support the recommendations of future studies to determine financial capabilities. Simulation use can improve upon our current approach to training using VR as an augmentation and immersion tool, as well as increase the capability of classroom training to include a possible combination of flight and ground school training by replacing PPT/classroom training to an incorporated approach to conducting in the VR device.
  
Admittedly, there will be challenges with the incorporation of VR as a training tool, with technical and cultural factors as the two primary concerns. The technical challenges we will address later in this document, and cultural challenges can be overcome with proper training on the equipment given to the instructor pilots (IPs) prior to the implementation of VR as a training tool. Cultural challenges are a huge concern with any change in current training approaches.
  
Not all VR is of the same quality, and of course as the quality, increases so does the price. However, costs continue to decrease with the rapid pace of technological innovations. The Army is in constant transition and is being left in the wake of current technological capabilities. Using VR as described in this study with the proper equipment is a viable option to augment the current training model for both classroom and flight training. 

Prepar3D (P3D)

Prepar3D (P3D) is a simulation software designed by Lockheed Martin and is a viable gaming and training software that possesses a multitude of uses for the military. Lockheed Martin plays a significant role in military development already, and this software just adds to their previous accomplishments. Prepar3D provides a wide range of scenarios and a virtual world consisting of over 40 highly detailed cities and nearly 25,000 already developed airports. Additional capabilities of this software are the ability to transition from day to night and adjust weather conditions for different training scenarios. 

Visual capabilities of this software outperform many other capable VR driving software currently on the market because of their 64-bit architecture enabling higher resolution and the ability for improved performance with the proper equipment. Necessary equipment to fulfill this capability will be discussed later in this document. With the customizable atmosphere and realistic topography, VR training capabilities are possible anywhere in the world that we can use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) navigation convention. This navigational approach allows for an extremely precise spatial reference with a degree of accuracy of less than two centimeters of error. This is also the same system we use in our current aircraft and across the Army.

Although this software is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) product, there are some limitations for the Army to use it as a training tool. Each computer that this software is loaded on must have its own individual license, and for a unit such as the Directorate of Simulation (DOS) to adjust the scenarios or flight models they must possess a developer license. Scenarios for this study were developed by a previous VR research study conducted on the capabilities of use in flight training, and PPT training was developed by the team members of this research project.  

Hellimod Mark III

The Helimod device used in this research is a motion-capable seat augmented with flight controls. The motion capability was not used for this research because the primary focus of this study is a comparison between VR and PPT. The Helimod’s full name is the Helimod Mark III, and it is designed by the Australian based company Ryan Aerospace. These same devices were used during the ATN testing and currently have generic flight controls which do not use any of the possible buttons or switches during this test. 

The Helimod device works just as a standard joystick would work, as a "plug-and-play" device. It is designed to be recognized by the computer as soon as it is plugged in to the USB port. The computer will recognize the Helimod as a game controller and has the capability of calibrating the control input to the desired sensitivity. 

The necessary space for using this device for testing and future training is minimal and the current setup for testing included two devices next to each other with approximately four feet between each device for safety while entering and exiting. 

HTC Vive Pro

The primary tool used in this research and comparison is the head-mounted display (HMD). For this research project the HMD of choice is the HTC Vive Pro produced by the HTC Company. The HTC Vive Pro is an evolution of the original Vive product and boasts a field of view (FOV) of 110 degrees. A significant attribute of this HMD is that both the eye relief (distance between eyes and device) and interpupillary distance (IPD) are adjustable. This provides for a more individualized fitting and can make the training experience more enjoyable. The HTC Vive Pro is an excellent choice for using in this test because it is designed to work with SteamVR which is already installed and developed to work in conjunction with P3D. SteamVR is a well-known gaming platform that allows for many other gaming functions to include linked capabilities. However, we will not discuss nor test those options in this project. Minimum recommended computer requirements can be found in Figure 3.
