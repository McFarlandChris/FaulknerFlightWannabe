## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Explain independent and dependent variables)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)


## Related Work

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

(Will combine into a clear background of related work after lit review is complete by team members)

Prepar3D (P3D) is a simulation software designed by Lockheed Martin and is a viable gaming and training software that possesses a multitude of uses for the military. Lockheed Martin plays a significant role in military development already and this software just adds to their previous accomplishments. Prepar3D provides a wide range of scenarios and a virtual world consisting of over 40 highly detailed cities and nearly 25,000 already developed airports. Additional capabilities of this software are the ability to transition from day to night and adjust weather conditions for different training scenarios. 

Visual capabilities of this software outperform many other capable VR driving software currently on the market because of their 64-bit architecture enabling higher resolution and the ability for improved performance with the proper equipment. Necessary equipment to fulfill this capability will be discussed later in this document. With the customizable atmosphere and realistic topography VR training capabilities are possible anywhere in the world that we can use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) navigation convention. This navigational approach allows for an extremely precise spatial reference with a degree of accuracy of less than two centimeters of error. This is also the same system we use in our current aircraft and across the Army.
