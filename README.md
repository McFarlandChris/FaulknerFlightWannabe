## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

Army Aviation consists of multiple levels of training, but all have one thing in common in that all Army qualified Aviators have graduated from the Basic Army Aviator Course (BAAC) at Fort Rucker, AL. This course is twenty-two weeks in length give or take a few days for weather delays in flight training. During this time prospective graduates are maintained on cohort schedule regardless of progression speed and capabilities. All training events during this time are completed by an Instructor Pilot (IP) and all students must complete this training, also known as Phase 1 of Army Aviator training. 

There have been several studies and assessments completed by the Army over the last 20 years on how to best train combat aviators but very little focus on training being completed through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and how it effects comprehension and trainability of future aviators. Previous research on the use of VR has been completed through a project call Aviator Training Next (ATN) which included three-hour increments of training in a new simulation device designed and researched during a one your research project conducted on Fort Rucker, AL. 

This ATN research had a primary research question of does VR provide a viable training tool for Army Aviation? With a resounding answer of yes to this question our group looks to build upon this research and identify a comparison of how students learn from a Power Point vice using the VR to train basic flight maneuvers prior to conducting live flight. 

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

Determine the propensity to produce a higher quality Army Aviator through the integration of a Virtual Reality Head Mounted Display (VR HMD) in combination with commercial off the shelf (COTS) flight software and cockpit simulators to compare training capabilities with students that receive the same instruction Power Point presentations only.

(Explain independent and dependent variables)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

Flight training is iherently expensive and both military and civilian organizations are looking for ways to reduce their budget. The question is how do you safely reduce the budget and live flight time safely. This study is not designed to provide that final answer, however provide some foundational information to show that VR is a viable training tool and can provide a more robust training capability instead of students sitting in a class room learining from PPT lectures. 

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

Quantitative analysis leverages a combination of experimental design and quasi-experimental design research. This experiment is composed of a two experimental groups of 24 students, groups A and B, which are composed of 12 students each. Group A will conduct training through the use of PPT only and be tested in the VR device. Group B will conduct training in VR and be tested in the VR device as well. All testing will be conducted at Fort Rucker, AL and be managed by the Directorate of Simulation for the United States Army Aviation Center of Excellence.

What is VR?
	This section is designed merely to give you the reader a brief explanation of what VR is and how that definition pertains to this study. It is not intended to delve deep into the subject of defining a virtual environment, of which has multiple definitions of its own. 
  
  Virtual reality is not necessarily a new phenomenon in the technology business however it continues to develop at a rapid pace to include the viability as a training tool. Virtual reality is simply put, a technology based on a computer that displays an input developed to an output from a computer designed to provide the user with an environment that reflects the real world (Gandhi, n.d.) and is a way to use computers to bring the digital world to life. This can include multiple senses being used simultaneously such as seeing, hearing, and touch. This is done using sights, sounds, and our sense of balance to immerse the user into a 100% digital world. An even more simple approach to this definition can be defined as using models and simulations computer equipment that allows a person to interact with an artificial 3D environment (Gandhi, n.d.).

	There are several types of VR such as enhanced, immersive, quick time, desktop, and hybrid, however this project will concentrate on the use of immersive VR. This type of VR allows the users rear world view as we know it to become computer generated images immersing you into a new world, which is the training environment used to compare results of training in PPT and VR. Additional key points of immersive VR are the fact that the user wears a head mounted display (HMD) and there is no visual contact to the physical environment. The HMD allows for constant tracking of where the individual is looking and although the HTC Vive Pro that is used in this study does not have a capability of eye tracking, there are several available additions that could add to the measurement of training performance allowing for a more in depth understanding and capabilities of each individual aviator. There is an ability of the observer to view where the student is looking via a monitor connect to the Helimod device used. 
  
	There is a plethora of applications where VR is used that range from entertainment to training in several domains to include military training. Virtual Reality (VR) as a term was coined by Jaron Lanier in 1987 and this technology was used in flight simulation as early as the 1950s where it was used to teach aspiring aviators how to fly as well as conduct emergency procedure training. The obvious advantage of this is that training can be conducted without crashing aircraft and as the cost of flight hours continues to rise there are budget advantages as well. This research is not going to cover budget however you can see how it can support the recommendations of future studies to determine financial capabilities. Currently Army Aviation conducts their training across the formation at a sixty percent live and forty percent simulation rate (FIND DOC). The current rate of live to simulation in flight school is XXXXX. Simulation use can improve upon our current approach in training using VR as an augmentation tool as well as increased capability of classroom training to include a possible combination of flight and ground school training by replacing PPT/classroom training to an incorporated approach to conducting in the VR device.
  
	Admittedly there will be challenges with the incorporation of VR as a training tool with technical and cultural as the two primary concerns. The technical challenges we will address later in this document and cultural challenges can be overcome with proper training on the equipment given to the instructor pilots (IPs) prior to the implementation of VR as a training tool. Cultural challenges were a huge concern with any change in current training approaches.
  
	Not all VR is of the same quality and of course as the quality increases so does the price, however costs continue to decrease with the rapid pace of technological innovations. The Army is in constant transition, and is being left in the wake of current technological capabilities. Using VR as described in this study with the proper equipment is a viable option to augment the current training model for both classroom and flight training. 
  
COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
Prepar3D (P3D)
  Prepar3D (P3D) is a simulation software designed by Lockheed Martin and is a viable gaming and training software that possesses a multitude of uses for the military. Lockheed Martin plays a significant role in military development already and this software just adds to their previous accomplishments. Prepar3D provides a wide range of scenarios and a virtual world consisting of over 40 highly detailed cities and nearly 25,000 already developed airports. Additional capabilities of this software are the ability to transition from day to night and adjust weather conditions for different training scenarios. 

  Visual capabilities of this software outperform many other capable VR driving software currently on the market because of their 64-bit architecture enabling higher resolution and the ability for improved performance with the proper equipment. Necessary equipment to fulfill this capability will be discussed later in this document. With the customizable atmosphere and realistic topography VR training capabilities are possible anywhere in the world that we can use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) navigation convention. This navigational approach allows for an extremely precise spatial reference with a degree of accuracy of less than two centimeters of error. This is also the same system we use in our current aircraft and across the Army.

  Although this software is a commercial of the shelf (COTS) product there are some limitations for the Army to use as a training tool. Each computer that this software is loaded on must have its own individual license and for a unit such as the Directorate of Simulation (DOS) to adjust the scenarios or flight models they must possess a developer license. Scenrios for this study were developed by a previous VR research conducted on the capabilities of use in flight training and PPT training was developed by the team members of this research project.
