## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

(I tell sutdents to answer the questions, one paragaph each to start if you are lost)

Army Aviation consists of multiple levels of training, but all have one thing in common in that all Army qualified Aviators have graduated from the Basic Army Aviator Course (BAAC) at Fort Rucker, AL. This course is twenty-two weeks in length give or take a few days for weather delays in flight training. During this time prospective graduates are maintained on cohort schedule regardless of progression speed and capabilities. All training events during this time are completed by an Instructor Pilot (IP) and all students must complete this training, also known as Phase 1 of Army Aviator training. 

There have been several studies and assessments completed by the Army over the last 20 years on how to best train combat aviators but very little focus on training being completed through the use of Virtual Reality (VR) and how it effects comprehension and trainability of future aviators. Previous research on the use of VR has been completed through a project call Aviator Training Next (ATN) which included three-hour increments of training in a new simulation device designed and researched during a one your research project conducted on Fort Rucker, AL. 

This ATN research had a primary research question of does VR provide a viable training tool for Army Aviation? With a resounding answer of yes to this question our group looks to build upon this research and identify a comparison of how students learn from a Power Point vice using the VR to train basic flight maneuvers prior to conducting live flight. 

(Problem Statement. One paragraph to describe the prob-lem that you are tackling.)

(Explain independent and dependent variables)

(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)

(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous para-graphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)

(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)

(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•	(Contribution 1)
•	(Contribution 2)


## Related Work

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

(Will combine into a clear background of related work after lit review is complete by team members)

Prepar3D (P3D) is a simulation software designed by Lockheed Martin and is a viable gaming and training software that possesses a multitude of uses for the military. Lockheed Martin plays a significant role in military development already and this software just adds to their previous accomplishments. Prepar3D provides a wide range of scenarios and a virtual world consisting of over 40 highly detailed cities and nearly 25,000 already developed airports. Additional capabilities of this software are the ability to transition from day to night and adjust weather conditions for different training scenarios. 

Visual capabilities of this software outperform many other capable VR driving software currently on the market because of their 64-bit architecture enabling higher resolution and the ability for improved performance with the proper equipment. Necessary equipment to fulfill this capability will be discussed later in this document. With the customizable atmosphere and realistic topography VR training capabilities are possible anywhere in the world that we can use the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS-84) navigation convention. This navigational approach allows for an extremely precise spatial reference with a degree of accuracy of less than two centimeters of error. This is also the same system we use in our current aircraft and across the Army.
